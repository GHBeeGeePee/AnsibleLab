 ansible example -m ping -u [username]




…where [username] is the user you use to log into the server. If everything worked, you should see a
message that shows www.example.com | success >>, then the result of your ping. If it didn’t work,
run the command again with -vvvv on the end to see verbose output. Chances are you don’t have
SSH keys configured properly—if you login with ssh username@www.example.com and that works,
the above Ansible command should work, too.


Ansible assumes you’re using passwordless (key-based) login for SSH (e.g. you login by
entering ssh username@example.com and don’t have to type a password). If you’re still
logging into your remote servers with a username and password, or if you need a primer
on Linux remote authentication and security best practices, please read Chapter 10 - Server
Security and Ansible. If you insist on using passwords, add the --ask-pass (-k) flag to
Ansible commands (you may also need to install the sshpass package for this to work).


Let’s run a more useful command:

$ ansible example -a "free -m" -u [username]



you have to define your hosts in the /etc/ansible/hosts file on your control server:

root@asus:/etc/ansible# cat hosts
[labhosts]
192.168.122.101
192.168.122.102
192.168.122.103
[vpnhosts]
10.147.18.1
10.147.18.14
10.147.18.72

root@asus:/etc/ansible# 


then we can do:


kevin@asus:~/LOCAL/WORK/AnsibleLab/mylan$ ansible vpnhosts   -a "hostname"
[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution ubuntu 22.04 on host 10.147.18.14 should use /usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for backward compatibility 
with prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the discovered platform python for this host. See 
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This feature will be removed in version 2.12. 
Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.

The above is correct since 10.147.18.1 the lenvpn is switched off right now.

ansible has found two machines - the aws server and the asus laptop, via the vpn lan network. 



another ad-hoc command:

kevin@asus:~/LOCAL/WORK/AnsibleLab/mylan$ ansible vpnhosts   -a "free"
